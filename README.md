### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Jimmy ###
Completely new to coding, journey started in January 2021 - learning the code one day at a time. 

- ğŸ”­ My journey in coding started on the LTU Reboot project that lasted 5 weeks (11th January to 11th February 2021).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and aiming to master HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
- ğŸ¥‹ Interesting fact: I'm a black belt in Karate.
